## Preface

[Read the paper here](https://github.com/allan1371/LOL-Metric-KDAV/blob/main/RoughDraft.pdf)

In an effort to learn python programming, data analysis, tableau, as well as learn about creating metrics, writing a paper, and everything that came with it, I had an idea to create a metric for the E-Sport of League of Legends. 

This was an idea cooking for a few years, but I did not know where to start or where to go with what I wanted to learn about and create, given absolutely no knowledge of programing, analysis, or presenting information.

Ultimately, I created an over 2,000 line (very inefficient) python application that assisted me in self inputting data from matches, exporting them to excel, and using Tableau to visualize the data.

I learned a lot throughtout this process, and someday, I plan to revisit and refine the application, data analysis, and re-write the paper, with the skills I am learning today, and lessons learned throughout this proccess.

## Conclusion

There are plenty of flaws in all aspects of this project, from the implementation of code, to the data manipulation on excel, the way I represented the data on Tableau, and finally the paper. 

But we all have to start somewhere, and I can't wait to look back at this someday, and realize this is how it began. 

Thank you.
